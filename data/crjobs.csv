We do this through access to the most comprehensive and accurate data, provided through powerful and flexible technology, giving businesses extensive insight into the core of their business. Infutor's data solutions drive essential business functions in identity verification, fraud and risk, marketing, analytics, multi-media, and compliance applications.
Infutor was formed in 2003 as a compiler of mass telephone and referential data assets. Since then, Infutor Data Solutions has grown into a full-service provider, producing world-class data solutions, which empower businesses to make critical, strategic decisions. In 2016, Infutor received a large strategic investment led by the growth equity team at Norwest Venture Partners, a global multi-stage investment firm with more than $6 billion in capital under management.
Infutor's headquarters are located in Oakbrook Terrace, IL. with offices in Chicago, IL., Fort Myers, FL., Olathe, KS. and San Rafael de Escazú, Costa Rica.
Position Description
As a Data Engineer at Infutor you will guide colleagues on how to ingest, store, process, analyze and explore/visualize data on our platforms. You will work on data migrations and transformational projects with colleagues to design large-scale data processing systems, data storage systems, develop data pipelines optimized for scaling, and troubleshoot potential platform issues.
In this role you are the Infutor Data Engineer working with Infutor's most strategic customers. Working as a

team, you will support customer implementation of Infutor products through architecture guidance, best

practices, data migration, capacity planning, implementation, troubleshooting, monitoring and much more.
This role will report to our Manager of Data Engineering and be based in our San Rafael de Escazú office.
Key Performance Indicators for this role are:
Self- management: Every piece of software developed, must be done following Agile methodologies. The developers must be self-managed, they should be able to gather requirements, then plan and estimate iterations based on it.

At the end of the iteration, they should perform reviews and retrospectives for identifying what can be improved on the next one.
Documentation: Every piece of software developed, must be well documented before it is coded. Documentation shouldn't be extensive but must help the developer to plan the solution before working on it.
Coding: Always apply best practices: write code that is easy to read, simple, easy to maintain, has good performance and can be extended. Code refactor whenever any of this attributes can be improved.
Support: Maintain and modify existing application software based on new software release requirements. Provide system support on production issues, user and tester needs.
Quality: Only deliver what is 100% finished. This includes what is fully tested.
Responsibilities and Duties
At Infutor, Data Engineers work in an Agile environment, so they need to fully understand and follow the principles

stated in the Agile Manifesto (http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Depending on the project, they need to work on self-organized teams or by themselves; in both cases they need to be self-motivated and independent. They need to work incrementally, willing to revisit work (code refactoring) and accepting that the big picture will

188,beenverified,"BeenVerified is looking for a Full-Stack Engineer to join our growing team in our Costa Rica office. Your experience here will give you the opportunity to touch upon and learn a broad spectrum of skills up and down the stack as well as breadth of technologies in any one layer. If you’re comfortable writing the backend APIs that your JS app consumes, helping with database decisions, debugging complex issues that span multiple systems, learning about infrastructure and working on cool new products then this might be the job for you. You will have a voice in what you build and you'll have the opportunity to prove your ideas right with data and testing. At BeenVerified, we all work closely together across teams so there's no red tape or bureaucracy. We get things done!
What You Will Get to Do
In our team of developers, every developer has some ownership of a portion of our architecture. There are several different applications, all with a roadmap of features and fixes that you can sink your teeth into. These range from our main Rails application (Rails, Unicorn, Nginx) to data collection and archiving (Redis, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Mongo, etc.). Most of our development is done in Ruby but we do have portions written in other languages as well (PHP, Go, etc).
A software engineer joining our team would be expected to not only handle the normal bug mashing and feature implementation but also work on making our software and processes more developer friendly. We expect members of our team to be vocal about problems that they see as we prefer to be proactive rather than reactive. If you're going through a code base and see inefficiencies that need to be attended to, we'll get them on the short-term road map or, in some cases, just work it into an existing task depending on what makes the most sense. Our engineering team is a strong proponent of the phrase ""leave it better than you found it.""
What You Bring to the Table
BS or MS in Computer Science, Math, Engineering or even a Ruby-centric developer bootcamp.
Minimum of 2 years of professional full-stack coding experience and have a good grasp of the Ruby language, the interpreter and Rails.
Familiarity with Ruby frameworks other than Rails (Sinatra, Padrino, EventMachine, etc.).
Intermediate level English required
Comfortable working with various databases and picking up new technologies.
Familiarity with Unix-based operating systems and Docker/Kubernetes
A passion to learn
Someone who takes the initiative to teach themselves cutting edge tech.
Excitement around performance optimizations, experimenting with new features, splitting big applications into smaller apps, and rapidly iterating on a piece of code.
Why BeenVerified?
BeenVerified builds exciting data products and then we market them with passion. We're a fast-growing company that balances the culture of a startup with the stability of being an established, profitable company. We want to work with people that strive to be in the top .01% of their field. We understand that getting to the top takes hard work, constant improvement, and by making data-driven decisions. It's a thrilling time to join the team, as we're expanding our product offerings in exciting new ways, driving innovation through data, marketing, and web & app development.
We believe in diversity and hiring people from all backgrounds and walks of life. You must be energetic, inventive, a team player and looking to help build and grow the company each and every day. You must have an inner desire to win and the idea of losing is a non-starter. If you are looking for a position that allows you to work with a group of smart and dedicated people who will support you but still provide the autonomy you need to execute your strategy, then you should probably apply as soon as you're done reading this!",https://cr.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=42aec151f4b574d2&fccid=7fcddd6c1a6bbbbd&vjs=3,"San José, Provincia de San José",Full-Stack Engineer
